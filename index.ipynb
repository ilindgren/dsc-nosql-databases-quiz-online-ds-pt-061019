    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Database is a Relational Database and a structured one whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational database likely to be more document and distributed than structured. Relational database strictly adheres relations where it is divided into the set of rows and columns to store data often named as tables, but the Non-relational database has a document-oriented or distributed storage which doesnâ€™t require any table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema for document type or unstructured data whereas SQL Databases have a well-designed pre-defined schema. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can scale the SQL  databases by expanding the strength of its hardware. Similarly, when it comes to NoSQL databases you can scale it by expanding the database servers in the pool of assets to lessen the heap. SQL uses hierarchical data storage, and there is no hierarchical data storage for SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database would be useful in the example of storing customer service messages between a company and their customers. Some messages may be short, whereas some messages may be dozens of messages long, thus cannot be referenced in a tabular format. SQL needs a clearly defined table to reference and query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data. ... Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, the MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents. A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. The fields in documents are akin to the columns in a relational database, and the values they contain can be a variety of data types, including other documents, arrays and arrays of documents, according to the MongoDB user manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents, which also must incorporate a primary key as a unique identifier, are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function as the equivalent of relational database tables. Collections can contain any type of data, but the restriction is the data in a collection cannot be spread across different databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault-tolerant technology is a capability of a computer system, electronic system or network to deliver uninterrupted service, despite one or more of its components failing. Fault tolerance also resolves potential service interruptions related to software or logic errors. The purpose is to prevent catastrophic failure that could result from a single point of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Resilient Distributed Dataset is a collection of an arbitrary number of server clusters that share a full dataset distributed between them. With multiple servers comes multiple opportunities for things like server failures, and our dataset is no good if we have no guarantee that part of our dataset might be missing when we go to query for it. RDDs have multiple servers with backups of each server on other servers so we can query all servers simultaniously without failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
